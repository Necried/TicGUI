Buglist:
1. Sometimes clicking buttons does not register at all
	Elaboration: Functions being called twice on run module
	Cause: See elaboration
	Fix: Create variables to store return values. Use variables for conditionals
2. At the main menu, clicking play causes the main menu screen to pop up again (resolves on second pass)
	Cause and Fix: See 1.
3. Re-looping the game causes an unexpected exit at SelectionPage()
	Cause: main() ends since there is no recursive call to it 
	Fix: recursively call main() everytime the player wants to play again 
4. Clicking at the board while it's computer's turn causes unexpected piece placement
